# D-ice Project

In this exercise, we will be creating a website that will simulate a throw of the dices. We will get some experience with Intermediate HTML, CSS and intermediate JS; in particular, we will be manipulating the DOM Tree.


## Instructions

- Select a color palette and set the body **background-color** accordingly
- Set the color of the fonts to a complementary color
- Use the Lobster cursive font for the header
    - Example of font assignment: _font-family: 'Roboto', normal;_
- Use the **Indie Flower**, cursive font in the announcements section.
- Create a new js file and link it to the HTML files.
- Set the starting images as dice 6 in the image tags already available
- Inside your js file, create a variable called randomNumber1 and assign to it a random number between 1-6
- Adjust the image in the display to match the result acquired in the previous step.
- Do the same for both dices
- Change the text in the **h1** tag to state the winner or a tie if there is one.
